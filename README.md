# My Personal Kanban Client
My Personal Kanban is exactly that, your very own Kanban Board! You can add cards to your to-do list, move them to being in progress, and then file them under complete so you know when to start the next task. Great for project managers who use agile and scrum methodologies or for anyone who just likes to check things off their to-do list.
